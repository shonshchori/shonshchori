### About me

An outstanding 3rd year Student of Industrial Engineering (Data Science major), creative and motivated with strong analytical and self-learning skills. Experienced in Python, SQL, and other tools, as well as in team leadership and management under pressure. Multitasker with excellent interpersonal communication and great teamwork skills.

:mortar_board: Besides the studies, I work on projects to keep developing and extending my knowledge about the data science world.

âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, my hobbies include running, reading, playing guitar and sometimes even drawing (although since I started my studies, my iPad is used more as a notebook rather than a drawing canvas).
